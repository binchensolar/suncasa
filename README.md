# suncasa

Required packages

- CASA 5.4.0, which comes with
  * NumPy 1.14.3
  * Matplotlib 1.1.0
  
Additionally, we need
- SunPy 0.9.3
- AstroPy 2.0.12

We will add more documentation to SunCASA shortly. Here are some latest examples for using SunCASA to reduce and visualize dynamic spectroscopic imaging data obtained from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA): http://www.ovsa.njit.edu/wiki/index.php/EOVSA_Data_Analysis_Tutorial. The same procedure has been tested to work well on data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA).
